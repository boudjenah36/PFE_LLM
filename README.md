## Overview

This framework consists of the following modules:
- Preprocessing: where you provide a link to a huggingface hosted dataset and define the preprocessing criterias
- Fine-tuning: where you specify the base LLM and the processed dataset as well as the training hyperparameters
- Generation: where you can test your fine-tuned model and generate answers and make conversations
- Evaluation: many evaluation metrics are available where you can evaluate your finetuned model on many aspects
  

## Features

- Easy setup and configuration
- Support for huggingface models and datasets
- Comprehensive experiment management
- Detailed performance evaluation and reporting through **weights and biases** integration
- Customizable and extensible

## Installation

To install LLM-Finetuner, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imadken/LLM-Finetuner.git
cd LLM-Finetuner

```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use LLM-Finetuner for your fine-tuning tasks:

### 1. Clone the Project

### 2. setup conda env

create a conda env from ```environment.yml```

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate myenv

conda env list
```
conda activate myenv


if you need to evaluate using LLM-based evaluation then you should switch to  ```environment-test.yml``` 

### 3. Configure the necessary Yaml files

- For each module, there is a yaml file to configure
- Before the evaluation, you need to generate answers and feed them to the evaluation module
- in the end, configure the ```main.yaml``` and run ```main.py```
